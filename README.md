As suggested by the name one of the main goals of OCR4all is to allow basically
any given user to independently perform OCR on a wide variety of historical printings
and obtain high quality results with reasonable time expenditure. Therefore, OCR4all
is explicitly planned even for users with no technical background.

This repository contains two guides. One deals with the installation process,
the second one gives a brief overview over the functionality using two historical
books (also available in this repository) as hands-on examples.

Both guides will be continuously improved and refined. Therefore, user feedback is
always welcome.
